----
MacSim v2.2.0

Update the documentation and add instructions for RHEL.

----
MacSim v2.1.1

Trace format has been updated.

----
MacSim v2.1.0

    1. Added support for Mac OS X
    
    2. SST-MacSim: Enable each core of MacSim instance to have its
       private instruction and data cache (memHierarchy).

    3. SST-MacSim: Enable receiving a trigger event from another SST
       component which will cause MacSim to begin execution, and
       returning an event to another SST component upon completion.

    4. Bug fixes

----
MacSim v2.0.3

Updated compatibility with SST 4.0.0 (rev. 8077)

Added reference results (and corresponding configuration) to compare
against for SST nightly tests.

----
MacSim v2.0.2

Updated compatibility with SST 3.1.2 (rev. 7085)

  1. MacSim is primarily a core component in SST (The Structural
     Simulation Toolkit - https://sst-simulator.org/).

  2. Tested out with MemHierarchy component as I$ and D$.

  3. In conjuction with MemHierarchy, MacSim can be configured with
     DRAMSim2 or VaultSim.

Note - Use "USE_MEMHIERARCHY' knob to use MemHierarchy cache. With it
turned off, MacSim doesn't interact with other component at all. It
works as if MacSim-standalone, but on top of SST framework.

----
MacSim v2.0.1

Fixes to GTX580 parameter file

----
MacSim v2.0.0

There are several major changes made since last release. (The svn repository
already has the latest version.)

  1. MacSim's Trace Format has been changed along with the trace
     configuration file format. For verification purposes, a few
     sample traces conforming to the new trace file format are
     included in this release. For your convenience, more x86 sample
     traces from spec2006 will also be provided.

     o To make sure your installation is complete (./build.py), please
       go check using $MACSIM_ROOT/bin/macsim binary. It searches for
       newly built executable and runs traces listed in
       trace_file_list to completion.

     o Please download sample traces provided in googlecode page and
       extract them under $MACSIM_ROOT/trace/ directory. You may need
       to modify trace_file_list to run more traces other than the
       included ones.

  2. MacSim is now compatible with Mac OS X.

     o We resolved a few compilation issues that arises with Mac
       environment.

     o Please note that only g++-4.7 is fully tested and other
       versions of compilers are not yet fully supported.

  3. Added SST-3.0.0 compatibility

     o There have been a lot of changes made to SST framework (The
       Structural Simulation Toolkit developed by Sandia National
       Laboratory) since its last release. We have made a transition
       from an older version of SST APIs to a newer version to make it
       compatible with SST-3.0.0.

----
